Web of Science advanced search by using puppeteer

# Introduction
Web of Science is an indexing service for quality scientific publications worldwide. If you have an ip access, usually in an university campus area, you can search for publications and citations online at their web site: http://apps.webofknowledge.com/
"Basic Search" option can be redirected from html forms, described and accessed here: http://wokinfo.com/webtools/searchbox/

Unfortunately, there isn't any form (at least I couldn't find) for "Advanced Search" option. You must go to, http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ click "Advanced Search" option, enter search terms, and click Search button.
If you don't search regulary, and know what to do this procedure is okay. But if you want to search for a lot of authors, or search for a lot of departments in an university, this is waste of time.
